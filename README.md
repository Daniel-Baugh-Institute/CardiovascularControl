# Base model (v03 directory)
This base model is for a generalized healthy individual. The model and associated scripts are set to reproduce the figures from "Closed-loop modeling of central and intrinsic cardiac nervous system circuits underlying cardiovascular control" (https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.18033). Additional information on running the model and reproducing the figures is in the readme of the v03 directory.

# Virtual patient cohorts
These models and scripts expand upon the base model to simulate virtual patient cohorts before and after a heart attack. These files are designed to reproduce the figures from "Computational modelling of cardiac control following myocardial infarction using an in silico patient cohort" (https://doi.org/10.1113/JP287596). Additional information on running the models and reproducing the figures is in the readme of the Virtual_patient_cohorts directory.
